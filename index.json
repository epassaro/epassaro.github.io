These data comes from a wide variety of sources (experiments) and measurements of the same quantity may differ depending on the source.\n A complete list of PRs made during the entire GSoC 2020 period can be found here.\n 1. Metadata for atomic files (PR #183) Reproducibility of scientific results is a must. We wanted to store all the information required to reproduce our atomic data files at any point in the future.\nThe main challenge was to find a convenient way to serialize Pandas\u0026rsquo;s objects (we chose PyArrow) and then calculate a checksum for every DataFrame stored in the atomic data file.\nThen, we store these checksumns and versions of relevant packageas and datasets.\nFinally, the atomic file is signed with a global checksum and a universally unique identifier (UUID1).\n2. Fix for heavy elements (PR #189) Missing total angular momentum (\u0026ldquo;j\u0026rdquo;) for some ground levels obtained from the NIST Atomic Spectra Database limited the usage of Carsus to species with atomic number (Z) lower than 59 [Pr].\nA small but critical patch made in collaboration with Stuart Sim allows Carsus to ingest atomic data from heavy elements.\n3. Collision strengths from Chianti DB (PR #190) The last piece of atomic data needed to fully replace the old Carsus SQL interface (\u0026ldquo;legacy\u0026rdquo;) were the collision strengths from Chianti.\n4. Energy levels and lines from CMFGEN (PR #191) My GSoC 2019 project involved writing parsers for CMFGEN files. This year, I wrote the code necessary to ingest energy levels and transition lines from this database into TARDIS atomic files.\nThis action required a complete refactor of the Carsus output module, including a complete revision of the priority management of the data sources.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s left to do? Nothing.\nFinal thoughts My plans for 2020 were really different to be honest. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure about to apply for Google Summer of Code again. But, in March I knew that this year was going to be \u0026ldquo;special\u0026rdquo;.\nAnd boy it was crazy. As an inhabitant of the southern hemisphere, GSoC passed during a long, long winter. I was grateful to have something to work on in these difficult times.\nIt has been an amazing two years journey. GSoC was a life-changing event for me, without any doubt. It happened at the right time, after some difficult years.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? I\u0026rsquo;m glad to say that I joined this fantastic organization and I will contributing to TARDIS-SN as long as possible.\nSee also   GSoC 2021 - Project\u0026rsquo;s Page  GSoC 2020 - Final Evaluation  Carsus\u0026rsquo;s Package Documentation  ","date":1598659441,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598659441,"objectID":"105ca824c1c4f1adaf7689aeef64a74a","permalink":"/post/gsoc20/","publishdate":"2020-08-28T21:04:01-03:00","relpermalink":"/post/gsoc20/","section":"post","summary":"Project “Comparing TARDIS spectra generated with different atomic data sources” for the TARDIS-SN organization, and mentored by Andreas Flörs, Christian Vogl, and James Gillanders.\n  Summary Through my second (and last) year as a Google Summer of Code student, I made several contributions to improve the Carsus package.\nTARDIS relies on Carsus to manage the atomic data necessary to run the simulations.
